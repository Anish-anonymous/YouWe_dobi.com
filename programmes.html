                <h3>EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS –</h3>The main motive of YouWe is to promote sex education in every
                educational
                institution , sex education will be given on three levels. Primary, secondary and tertiary levels of sex
                education according to the age of the individual or group of individuals. <br>
                Lack of sex education is main cause of rape . Whenever people hear the word sex the general social taboo
                comes in our mind , or about sex education people just assume that we are talking bout intercourse.
                Intercourse is a very mere part of sex education. Infact it is not all related to intercourse. Lack of
                proper Knowledge among youth and the taboos about gender differences can provoke one to do some Immoral
                acts. Education is not just the bookish knowledge . People think not Educating kids about these things
                will save them or its bad to tell them about these things , but that’s not true at all not tell them
                about these things is a bad decision, we have to tell them about the danger then can be in.

                covering
                different topics which are needed to discussed ;breaking all the social taboos and assumptions , in form

                about the norms and myth related to to mensuration and the breaking them. <br>
                Lack of awareness is the one of the biggest reasons that we have such problems in the society. People
                lack knowledge and they build norms and taboos about things. Leading to confusion and problems.
